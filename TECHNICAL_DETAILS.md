#### Docker:
- **What It Does**: Containerizes our backend and Ollama services, ensuring identical performance across Windows, Linux, macOS, and beyond.
- **Setup**: Requires Docker or Docker Desktop. Configured via `docker-compose.yml` with memory limits (8 GB for backend, 6 GB for Ollama).
- **Why**: Solves environment inconsistencies, making deployment a breeze for any platform, from desktops to cloud servers.

#### Ollama:
- **What It Does**: Runs local LLM inference (`llama3.1:8b`) for natural language processing, keeping data private and offline-capable.
- **Setup**: Installed with `curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh`, model pulled with `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`, exposed on port 11434.
- **Why**: Avoids cloud latency and costs, perfect for users with shaky internet or privacy concerns.

#### Python 3.10:
- **What It Does**: The backbone of our backend, supporting a vast ecosystem of AI and image processing libraries.
- **Setup**: Uses `python:3.10-slim` as the base image in Dockerfile, with dependencies installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Why**: Offers robust compatibility and a rich library set, making it the go-to for AI-driven projects.

#### Blender 3.6.0:
- **What It Does**: Our 3D modeling powerhouse, extended by a custom add-on to execute AI-generated scripts.
- **Setup**: Installed from official site, add-on loaded via `blender_addon.py` in Preferences.
- **Why**: Open-source, extensible, and widely adopted, it‚Äôs the perfect canvas for our innovations.

#### AI Models:
- **spaCy + llama3.1:8b**: Parses and interprets text prompts with precision.
    - **Setup**: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`, Ollama handles `llama3.1:8b`.
- **Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large + facebook/detr-resnet-50**: Analyzes images for captions and object detection.
    - **Setup**: Downloaded via `transformers` from Hugging Face.
- **openai-whisper**: Transcribes audio into actionable text.
    - **Setup**: `pip install openai-whisper`.

#### OpenCV:
- **What It Does**: Processes canvas drawings, detecting shapes for 3D conversion.
- **Setup**: Installed via `pip install opencv-python` in `requirements.txt`.
- **Why**: Its edge detection and contour analysis are perfect for translating sketches into 3D.

#### SQLite:
- **What It Does**: Stores scene context (e.g., object metadata) for persistent editing.
- **Setup**: Managed with `sqlite3` in `backend.py`, file at `/app/scene_context.db`.
- **Why**: Lightweight and efficient, with an in-memory fallback for flexibility.

#### Git:
- **What It Does**: Enables version control for collaborative development.
- **Setup**: Standard Git workflow with `git init`, commit, and push.
- **Why**: Essential for team scaling and code integrity.

### Components:

- **Blender Add-on**: The user-facing UI, sending HTTP requests to the backend.
- **FastAPI Backend**: The brain, orchestrating AI, OpenCV, and script generation.
- **Ollama**: Local LLM powerhouse for advanced text interpretation.
- **AI Models**: Transformers-based engines for multimodal input processing.

## System Workflow - The Magic Pipeline! üîÑ

### Input Reception:
- **Text**: Captured via add-on text field, sent as JSON to `/process`.
- **Image**: Uploaded as base64, processed by AI models.
- **Audio**: Recorded or uploaded, transcribed by Whisper.
- **Canvas**: Drawn on `canvas_template.png`, encoded as base64, analyzed by OpenCV.

### Processing Engine:
- **NLP**: `spaCy` tokenizes text, `llama3.1:8b` interprets intent (e.g., "red sphere" ‚Üí shape + color).
- **Image**: `blip-image-captioning-large` captions, `detr-resnet-50` detects objects.
- **Audio**: `openai-whisper` converts speech to text, fed into NLP.
- **Canvas**: OpenCV detects contours (e.g., circle ‚Üí sphere, line ‚Üí cylinder), mapped to 3D primitives.

### Script Generation:
- Backend combines AI/OpenCV outputs with `themes.json` themes, crafting Blender Python scripts (e.g., `bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add()`).

### Execution:
- Scripts returned to add-on, executed in Blender, updating the scene.

### Output:
- Updated 3D scene with optional base64 preview image.
